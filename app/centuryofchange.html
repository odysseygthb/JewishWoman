        Over the course of the 20th century European society has experienced dramatic social, political and economic transformation. Nowhere is this more apparent than in the margins of European society, minorities groups who experienced both expanded opportunity and the painful limitations of this opportunity throughout the century. Jewish women are no exception to this, discriminated against due to both their sex and their religion.

      <p class="century__info">
        This digital exhibit documents these changes through the lives of eight game changing Jewish women whose lives have been documented in documented in photographs, videos, and works of art. Each of these women is exceptional in her individual accomplished but also representative of larger themes which transcend both religion and gender. The diversity of these womenâ€™s paths speaks to the diversity of the twentieth century European experience in Europe and beyond.
